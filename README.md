#mortgage rate
Users can type in the mortgage rate they want, or they can pick from a list of mortgage options, ie 2-3-5 years at all the different mortgage rates.  We can fetch this in real-time from some API?  
Question
How does changing the mortgage rate affect the previously rated units?  Because their cash flow projections changes with a different rate.
